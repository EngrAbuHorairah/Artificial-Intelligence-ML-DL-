## 2. Overview of the Problem set 
The dataset consists of a training set and a test set of images labeled as cat or non-cat. Each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3), representing RGB channels. The goal is to build an image recognition algorithm that can accurately classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
