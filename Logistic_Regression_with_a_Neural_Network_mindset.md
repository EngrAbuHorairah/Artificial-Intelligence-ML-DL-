## 1. Introduction
This project implements logistic regression with a neural network mindset to classify images as either cats or non-cats. The code is written in Python using NumPy for matrix operations and matplotlib for visualization.

## 2. Overview of the Problem set
The dataset consists of a training set and a test set of images labeled as cat or non-cat. Each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3), representing RGB channels. The goal is to build an image recognition algorithm that can accurately classify pictures as cat or non-cat.

## 3. General Architecture of the Learning Algorithm
The algorithm involves the following steps:
- Initialize parameters (weights and bias)
- Learn the parameters by minimizing the cost function using gradient descent
- Use the learned parameters to make predictions
- Analyze the results and conclude

## 4. Building the Parts of Our Algorithm
- Helper functions like sigmoid, parameter initialization, and forward/backward propagation are implemented.
- Optimization function to update parameters using gradient descent is defined.
- Predict function to calculate predictions based on learned parameters is implemented.

## 5. Merge All Functions into a Model
The model function integrates all the building blocks to build the logistic regression model. It initializes parameters, optimizes them using gradient descent, makes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance.

## 6. Usage
To use this model, follow these steps:
- Ensure Python and required libraries are installed
- Import the necessary functions from the provided files
- Load the dataset using load_dataset() function
- Preprocess the data (flatten and normalize)
- Build the model using the model function
- Train the model on the training set
- Evaluate the model's performance on the test set
- Analyze the results and make conclusions
