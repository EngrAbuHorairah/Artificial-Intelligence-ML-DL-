# Artificial-Intelligence (ML-DL)
This repository consists on various Machine learning, Deep learning, Neural Network Based Artificial Intelligence projects 

# 1. Python Practice with Numpay
This practice enable us to make machine learning and deep learning pojects effeciently.

# 2. Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset
## Overview of the Problem set 
The dataset consists of a training set and a test set of images labeled as cat or non-cat. Each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3), representing RGB channels. The goal is to build an image recognition algorithm that can accurately classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
